## Frontend developer take-home assignment

### Project brief
First things first: thank you for taking the time to take this test. We know how much your time is worth, and we greatly
appreciate your effort.

To work on this project:
 1. Clone this repository
 2. Create your app inside the repository, with the directory structure of your choice
 3. When you're done, submit a pull request with your solution
 4. Send an email to frontend-assignment@neulabs.com to notify the delivery of your project

### Project requirements
You will have to create a small [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for the component defined in the following Figma files:

**Design**
https://www.figma.com/file/VrkWJvZ5Cm0gjPSSnw4y7U/Test-Frontend?node-id=16%3A2

**Prototype**
https://www.figma.com/proto/VrkWJvZ5Cm0gjPSSnw4y7U/Test-Frontend?page-id=18%3A1149&node-id=18%3A2553&viewport=408%2C48%2C0.5&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=18%3A2553&show-proto-sidebar=1

**Product specs**
1. The component must be responsive, according to the specs defined in the "Design" file. Define the breakpoints of your media queries using your best judgement
2. The animation is the same both in mobile and desktop
3. The component must be reusable with different maps
4. Define the stories inside your storybook based on the different states / configurations the component can assume

**Code specs**

2. Please maintain a consistent code code style throughout the entire project

### Project deadline
Take the time you need to deliver a result that satisfies you, but please do not go over the 2 weeks.

### Quality assurance
We value a lot of things when assessing a project. No particular hints on this, but this one: mind the details. ;-)

Happy coding!
